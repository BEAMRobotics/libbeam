# beam_cv

This module contains functions and classes commonly used in image processing/computer vision.

## geometry

Common 3D computer vision geometric algorithms are implemented here to work with our camera models:
1. PoseEstimator (8 and 7 point algorithms for estimation essential matrix)
2. Triangulation (linear triangulation between two cameras)
3. P3P
